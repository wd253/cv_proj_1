# cv_proj_1

to execute:
1. python train.py
2. python eval.py

to make heatmap:   python heatmap.py
to check heatmap:  python heatmap_visual.py

You can see heatmaps in CV_train/HeatmapVisuals.

The current model training results show that the bounding boxes are not being drawn correctly at all, so further modifications and debugging are necessary.
